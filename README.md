# Playout
Playout will allow individual users to select fields on any object that are important to them. Treat it as your Personal Page Layout.


<ul>
<li>Personalized Page Layout</li>
<li>See what's important to you</li>
<li>Increase Efficiency</li>
</ul>

Page Layouts allow an admin to configure fields that's important to an organization. This app allows further control to individual users to configure which fields are important to them. It allows users to filter noise from a page layout and be even more productive.
